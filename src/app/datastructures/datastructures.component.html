<h2>DATA STRUCTURE</h2>

<div class="mt-4">
  <p class="mt-3">
    Data structures are fundamental constructs around which you build your application. 
    A data structure determines the way data is stored, and organized in your computer. 
    Whenever data exists it must have some kind of data structure in order to be stored in a computer.
  </p>

  <br />

  <h4>Contiguous or Linked Data Structures</h4>
  <p class="mt-3">
    Data structures can be classified as either contiguous or linked, 
    depending whether they are based on arrays or pointers (references):
  </p>
  <ul class="list-display">
    <li>
      <strong>Contiguous-allocated structures :</strong> 
      <br />
      These are made of single slabs of memory, 
      some of these data structures are Arrays, Matrices, Heaps, and Hash Tables.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Linked data structures :</strong> 
      <br />
      It is composed as distinct chunks of memory linked together by pointers (references). 
      Some of this data structures are lists, trees, and graph adjacency lists.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h4>Comparison</h4>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Some advantages of linked lists over static arrays are:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-display">
      <li>
        Overflow is more difficult to occur on a linked structures than it is in an array. 
        It only happens when the memory is actually full.
      </li>
      <li>Insertions and deletions are simpler than for contiguous data structures such as arrays.</li>
      <li>Linked list don't need to know size on initialization.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    
    <p>
      Advantages of arrays:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-display">
      <li>Linked structures require allocating extra space for storing pointers.</li>
      <li>Arrays allow efficient access to any item.</li>
    </ul>
